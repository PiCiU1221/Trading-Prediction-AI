The results are pretty mediocre, but it was still a fun experience

I got the training data from free Alpaca trading history API.
For the model training i calculated the trading indicators based on the previous values and then added them to the downloaded datasheets. It was later used to improve the model.

I didn't include all the datasheets because some of them were ~500MB.
